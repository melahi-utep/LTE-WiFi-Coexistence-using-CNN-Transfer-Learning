# LTE-WiFi-Coexistence-using-CNN-Transfer-Learning
In the ever-expanding landscape of wireless connectivity, where the demands for spectrum resources grow ever more insatiable, we stand at a crossroads of innovation and collaboration. In the pursuit of a harmonious coexistence between LTE and Wi-Fi technologies, we embarked on a journey fueled by the transformative power of CNN transfer learning.

Recognizing LTE technology in unlicensed bands (LTE-U) as a beacon of hope amidst the scarcity of spectrum resources, we endeavored to unlock its full potential while preserving the integrity of existing Wi-Fi networks. Armed with the formidable arsenal of MATLAB's deep learning toolbox, we embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries of signal classification.

Through painstaking analysis of data collected from our software-defined radio testbed, meticulously orchestrated within the framework of LabVIEW LTE and 802.11, we delved deep into the heart of the spectral domain. Our journey led us to the doorstep of GoogleNet, AlexNet, and ResNet, each a titan in its own right, standing as a testament to the power of innovation in the face of adversity.

With unwavering determination and unyielding resolve, we charted a course towards a brighter tomorrow, where LTE and Wi-Fi stand hand in hand, united in purpose and vision. And as the dust settles on our journey of discovery, we stand humbled by the magnitude of our achievements, where accuracy reigns supreme at an astonishing 96.7%.

In the crucible of innovation, where ideas converge and boundaries dissolve, we have forged a path forward, a testament to the power of collaboration and the unyielding spirit of progress.
